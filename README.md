# Game of Life

A C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life (with standard rules), optimised heavily for multi-threaded CPU.

It's pretty much optimised as far as my knowledge permits.  
Could it be optimised more? Probably - please feel free to make suggestions.


#### Requirements
 - Microsoft Windows system.
 - Visual Studio with C++17 support.
 - CPU with AVX2 support.
